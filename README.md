Assessment   Description
This assessment   involves developing the   requirements, high-level design and implementation for the Automated Assessment Tool (AAT)   project. The cohort has been   provided with a scenario   in a separate document, available on   Learning   Central.   this   assessment involves team working, each   team member is   expected to   contribute   to   the   team component and compile an individual   portfolio   of work consisting   of:
1.      User Story    Acceptance   Criteria
2.      Non-functional   requirements (also   known as Software product quality)
3.      Test   Cases
4.      Developing the   prototype
5.    Video   demonstration
6.      Peer  Self-Assessment
Please   make sure to cite any   references used   in the   assessment   using   one   of the   following   referencing styles:   Cardiff Harvard or IEEE (one or   the   other,   not   both!). The   guides and example of how to   use these   referencing styles are   found   at:

Task   1:   User Story  Acceptance Criteria
These   requirements should be stored   in GitLab and   you   can   use   them   to   track   the   progress of your project   next term.
Your team should create a project   in the   School’s   GitLab. The   project   name   should   identify   your   team   name:   [TeamName]CMT313_Assessment2   (eg:   Team12CMT313_Assessment2)
Make sure all your team members and all the   members   of the teaching   team   are   given   Maintainer permission to your project on GitLab.   Teaching   Team   (not   limited   to)   includes   Usashi Chatterjee, Annelies Gibson,   Rochan   Rochan, Sunbul Ahmad, Carl Jones.
Please follow the steps to achieve   Task   1:
1.    As a team, develop a top-level   Use   Case   diagram   that   highlights   the   most   important   features   and   services   the   system   will   provide.   Each   Use   Case   should   be   named   appropriately   from the client’sor user’s point of   view. (This task will   not   be assessed.).
2.      Individual submission:   Include the top-level   Use Case diagram (from   [1]) as   a   figure   in your proforma.   Each team member will be   responsible for specifying   one of the   key   Use Cases.   Every team member   should select a   different   Use   Case and      develop   it as a   User Story with clear acceptance criteria,   ensuring that   each   story   is written   in away that makes it easily validated.   Each   User   Story,   along   with   its   acceptance criteria, should be created as a   separate   issue   in   GitLab.   All   issues   must   be accessible directly from each   issue's page,   rather than   being available   as   a   downloaded document. The ‘Assessment Proforma’ document   must also   include a   table with working   links to the   relevant issues   in GitLab   It should   use the following   format:

代做程序编程语言  Diagram   Team X
Use Case   Name
Student   ID
Link to GitLab   Issue
Eg:Use Case   1
C1234567

Task 2.   Non-functional   requirements
1.    As a team, you   need to work together to   create   a   complete   list   of   non-functional   requirements (these are   requirements   that describe the quality of the software,   such   as   performance, security,   usability, etc.) for your system. This   part   is a group effort,         and the list should cover all relevant   non-functional   aspects   of your system   [Not assessed].
2.      Individual submission:   Each team member must submit the full   list of   non-functional requirements that the team   has created.   Additionally, each   member      needs to select their own top   five (5) non-functional   requirements from this   list.
3.      Justification:   For each of the five chosen   requirements, the team member should provide a justification explaining why they believe these requirements are   important.
4.    Testable   Requirements: The selected   requirements should   be formulated   in   a way   that allows them to be easily tested. This   means that the   requirements   should   be         clear, specific, and   measurable so that they can   be verified through testing.
Note: The five non-functional   requirements chosen   by each   team member   do   not   have   to   be the same as those   chosen by   other team   members.   Each   person   may   have   a different perspective on which   requirements are the   most   important.
Task 3. Test Cases   (ONE TEST   CASE   only)
Although this   is an   individual   portfolio the test case handed in   by   each   member   of your   team   MUST be for a different main   requirement. You can   refer to   the AAT   Prototype   Features and Mark Scheme sheet attached for the   main   requirements.   Each test case   should be presented   using the test case template   supplied   in   the   lecture   notes:
•             Create   ONE test   case that   a   user can   follow   to   validate   that   your   prototype   meets   ONE   of   the   main   requirements.   Each Test   Case   should   have   a   clear   procedure,   and   input   Data   that can be followed by a tester to carryout the essential steps for the basic flow and a clear   indication of   the outputs   that   your prototype should give in response to the tester’sactions.   (You   can   also   provide wireframe   diagrams to   help them   carry   out   the   tests.      These will   be   used to help determine if you have provided   sufficient   information   in your test   case to   cover   the essential steps for each   requirement.)
Task 4.   Developing the   prototype (700 words   limit)
Explain and evaluate the effectiveness   of your team whilst developing the   prototype. This   section should consider the   project   management and development methodologies your   team used alongside team dynamics covered   in the   module.   (Artifacts such   as   -   charts, and boards appropriate to the methodology   used   can   be   included   in an   appendix   of 3 pages   max)
Task 5. Video    Quality   Criteria
Walk through demonstration,   including software quality criteria of the elements of the   prototype you developed.
Make    a    video       (Maximum       of    5-minutes)    with       narrative    that       runs    through      the      working   functionality of the   prototype that you developed, This video should:•         clearly showing how your section integrates with other related sections   of the   prototype.
•         as   part   of the   demonstration   highlight   TWO   examples   of   how   and   where   your   part   of   the final product took into consideration software   quality   criteria   (e.g.   usability,   reliability,   integrity,   maintainability,   testability,   and   flexibility),   identified   in   Task   2.   Non-functional   requirements section.
•          highlight       any       extra       features       or       interesting       functionality       that       were       successfully   implemented.
Task 6.   Peer and Self-assessment (use form   provided, max   1   page   per   student)
•                         Looking    back    at    your    experience    having    undertaken    the    team    exercise    for    module
CMT313   Software   Engineering during the Autumn and   Spring semester, complete   a   peer/self-   assessment for each member of your team including yourself.
